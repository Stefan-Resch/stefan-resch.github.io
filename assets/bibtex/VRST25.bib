abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) alters perception and motor behavior through avatar embodiment, where spatial judgments align with the body and gait is influenced by the Proteus effect and bodily affordances. While specific footwear, such as an orthopedic boot, affects gait in the real world (RW), direct comparisons with their VR representations remain underexplored. Therefore, we conducted a within-subject study with 18 participants, testing three footwear types (shoes, socks, and an orthosis) that were presented physically in RW or virtually in VR during treadmill walking. We measured gait parameters, embodiment, and workload. Results showed that the orthosis in RW influenced gait and perceived workload, whereas the orthosis in VR affected foot rotation angles and perceived control/agency without increasing workload. Qualitative feedback indicated that some participants experienced altered walking when using different footwear in VR. Our study highlights the impact of mismatches between physical footwear and their virtual representations, offering insights for VR-based gait training applications.},
