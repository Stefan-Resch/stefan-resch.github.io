ABSTRACT = {Smart assistive technologies such as sensor-based footwear and walking aids offer promising opportunities for gait rehabilitation through real-time feedback and patient-centered monitoring. While biofeedback applications show great potential, current research rarely explores integrated closed-loop systems with device- and modality-specific feedback. In this work, we present a modular sensor-based system combining a smart foot orthosis and an instrumented forearm crutch to deliver real-time vibrotactile biofeedback. The system integrates plantar pressure and motion sensing, vibrotactile feedback, and wireless communication via a smartphone application. We conducted a user study with eight participants to validate the system’s feasibility for mobile gait detection and app usability, and to evaluate different vibrotactile feedback types across the orthosis and forearm crutch. The results indicate that pattern-based vibrotactile feedback was rated as more useful and suitable for regular use than simple vibration alerts. Moreover, participants reported clear perceptual differences between feedback delivered via the orthosis and the forearm crutch, indicating device-dependent feedback perception. The findings highlight the relevance of feedback strategy design beyond hardware implementation and inform the development of user-centered haptic biofeedback systems.},
