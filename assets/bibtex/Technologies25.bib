ABSTRACT = {Smart walking aids represent a growing trend in assistive technologies designed to support individuals with mobility impairments in their daily lives and rehabilitation. Previous research has introduced sensor-integrated systems that provide user feedback to enhance safety and functional mobility. However, a comprehensive overview of their technological and functional characteristics is lacking. To address this gap, this scoping review systematically mapped the current state of research in sensor-based walking aids, focusing on device types, sensor technologies, application contexts, target populations, and reported outcomes. In addition, integrated artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches for functional support and health monitoring were examined. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 35 peer-reviewed articles were identified from three databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science. Extracted data were thematically analyzed and synthesized across device types (e.g., walking canes, crutches, walkers, rollators) and use cases, including gait training, fall prevention, and daily support. Findings show that, while many prototypes show promising features, few have been evaluated in clinical settings or over extended periods. A lack of standardized methods for sensor location assessment, often the superficial implementation of feedback modalities, and limited integration with other assistive technologies were identified. In addition, system validation and user testing lack consensus, with few long-term studies and often incomplete demographic data. Diversity in data communication approaches and the heterogeneous use of AI algorithms were also notable. The review highlights key challenges and research opportunities to guide the future development of intelligent, user-centered mobility systems.},
